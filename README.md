Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning Algorithms:

This repository contains code and data related to the prediction of diabetes using machine learning algorithms. The project utilizes logistic regression and random forest algorithms to perform the predictions.

Introduction:

Diabetes is a prevalent chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and prediction of diabetes can aid in better management, prevention, and timely intervention for individuals at risk.

The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can predict the likelihood of diabetes based on relevant attributes and features. By leveraging data analysis and predictive modeling, we aim to provide valuable insights and potential tools for healthcare professionals and individuals concerned about their health.

Data:

The data used for training and testing the machine learning models covers the diabetes outcome between 2018 and 2022. The dataset includes the following attributes:

•	HighBP: Indicates whether the individual has high blood pressure (1 for yes, 0 for no)

•	HighChol: Indicates whether the individual has high cholesterol (1 for yes, 0 for no)

•	CholCheck: Indicates whether the individual has undergone cholesterol checks (1 for yes, 0 for no)

•	BMI: Body Mass Index of the individual

•	Smoke: Indicates whether the individual is a smoker (1 for yes, 0 for no)

•	Stroke: Indicates whether the individual has had a stroke (1 for yes, 0 for no)

•	HeartDiseaseorAttack: Indicates whether the individual has had a heart disease or heart attack (1 for yes, 0 for no)

•	PhysicalActivity: Level of physical activity of the individual

•	Fruits: Frequency of fruit consumption

•	Veggies: Frequency of vegetable consumption

•	AlcoholConsump: Frequency of alcohol consumption

•	AnyHealthcare: Indicates whether the individual has received any healthcare (1 for yes, 0 for no)

•	NoDocbcCost: Indicates whether the individual has no doctor due to the cost (1 for yes, 0 for no)

•	GenHlth: General health rating of the individual

•	MentHlth: Mental health rating of the individual

•	PhysHlth: Physical health rating of the individual

•	DiffWalk: Difficulty in walking experienced by the individual

•	Sex: Gender of the individual

•	Age: Age of the individual
