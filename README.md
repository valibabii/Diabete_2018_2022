Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning Algorithms
This repository contains code and data related to the prediction of diabetes outcome using attributes as: high blood pressure, and stroke using machine learning algorithms. The project utilizes logistic regression and random forest algorithms to perform the predictions.

Introduction
Diabetes is a prevalent chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. High blood pressure and stroke are common comorbidities associated with diabetes. Early detection and prediction of these conditions can aid in better management and preventive measures.

The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can predict diabetes outcome, high blood pressure, and stroke based on relevant attributes and features. By leveraging data analysis and predictive modeling, we aim to provide valuable insights and potential tools for healthcare professionals and individuals concerned about their health.
